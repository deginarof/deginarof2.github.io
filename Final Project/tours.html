                <p>While the island is not particularly well known for its beaches, there are beautiful areas of magnificent powdery white sand, a by-product of the numerous coral reefs surrounding the island. Among the most popular and attractive of Cozumel's
                    beaches are Playa San Juan and Playa Santa Pilar in the northwest corner of the island, and Playa San Francisco, Playa Santa Rosa, and Playa Palancar to the southwest. Of note on the east side, which opens to the Caribbean Sea, are
                    Playa Encantada, Playa Hanan, Punta Morena, Playa Chen Río, and Playa Chiqueros. Also worth a visit are Playa Mia Grand Beach Park, a popular spot for snorkeling due to its easy access to the coral reefs at El Cielo.

                <h1 class="titleTwo">Laguna Chankanaab and the National Marine Park</h1>
                <p>One of the most interesting natural attractions on Cozumel is Laguna Chankanaab, a small freshwater lake just seven kilometers south of San Miguel de Cozumel in the National Marine Park. Cut off from the sea (apart from a number of underground
                    channels), it's a popular spot for outings thanks to its crystal-clear water and numerous colorful tropical fish, and is an enchanting place to swim, snorkel, and scuba dive. The lagoon is now part of an adventure park surrounding
                    it, called Chankanaab Beach Adventure Park, where guests can enjoy activities including a sea-lion show, a dolphin swim experience, and a crocodile exhibition. Other fun things to do include ziplining and treetop climbing, as well
                    as a visit to an authentic Mayan home to sample traditional foods.</p>

                <h1 class="titleThree">Cozumel's Mayan Heritage: San Gervasio</h1>
                <p>More than 30 Mayan sites have been found on Cozumel, some of them in beautiful locations such as dense jungle or perched above pristine beaches. By far the most important is that of San Gervasio, built in AD 800 and located 16 kilometers
                    from San Miguel de Cozumel. Highlights of a visit include seeing the Temple of Ix-chel, for centuries the focal point of the island's religious life and a place of pilgrimage from across the Mayan empire. Also of interest are the nearby
                    ruins at Santa Rita, while a little farther away are the ruins of Santa Pilar and Castillo Real, the latter boasting Cozumel's largest Mayan structure. There are also Mayan remains in the southeast corner of the island at Buenavista
                    and in the south at El Caracol.</p>
